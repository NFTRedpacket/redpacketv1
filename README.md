# Redpacket v1

Core smart contract of Red Packet v1

**What is RedPacket?**

Red packet is a tool to store crypto money (currently ETH) in NFT. When the NFT is transfered to others, the crypto money stored in is also transfered. In Asian cultures, red packet (or red envelope) is a monetary gift given during holidays or for special occasions such as a wedding, graduation or the birth of a baby. So I think red-packet is a good name to descripe what we do with NFT.
