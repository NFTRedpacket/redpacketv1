### What is RedPacket?

Red packet is a tool to store crypto money (currently ETH) in NFT. When the NFT is transfered to others, the crypto money stored in is also transfered. In Asian cultures, red packet (or red envelope) is a monetary gift given during holidays or for special occasions such as a wedding, graduation or the birth of a baby. So I think red-packet is a good name to descripe what we do with NFT.

### Why build this?
It's cool if I can store money in NFT, with red-packet, the NFT is not only an NFT, but also has real value.
