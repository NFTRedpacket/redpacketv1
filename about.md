### Why we build RedPacket?

Red packet is a tool to store crypto money (currently ETH) in NFT. When the NFT is transfered to others, the crypto money stored in is also transfered. In Asian cultures, red packet (or red envelope) is a monetary gift given during holidays or for special occasions such as a wedding, graduation or the birth of a baby. So I think red-packet is a good name to descripe what we do with NFT.

But why I want to store money in NFT ? A few months ago, I bought some NFT, and sent it to my girl friend,  I thought it's so cool as a birthday gift. When my gl got the NFT, she thought that it was just a jpeg and it's nothing. It really frustrated me, so I think I should make some magic, the magic is to give NFT real value - the simplest way is to store money in it. So when she received an NFT, she received an NFT and some real money, that's very cooool!!!
